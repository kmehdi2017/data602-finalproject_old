		<label class="lblsym">The scope, limitations and assumptions:</strong></strong></label><br>The project is limited to the USDT market in the BITTREX exchange for currency and price information. The historical data is collected from cryptocompare.com through their API. crytocompare.com was selected since it collects information from several exchanges and was assumed to provide a better insight of a currency's trading information and market status.

		<br><br>USDT was selected as the base price. The difference between USDT and true USD was ignored and no conversion was made. In this project USDT was assumed to be exactly equal to USD and all the values were treated that way. 

		<br><br>The application uses mongoDB to store and retrieve all trading information. This mongoDB is hosted in the cloud (mongoDB Atlas ). Note:  for this project no effort was made to hide the connection string </label>
